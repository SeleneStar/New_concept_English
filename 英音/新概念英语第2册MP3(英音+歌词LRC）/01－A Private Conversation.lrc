[00:09.77]Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?
[00:15.91]Last week I went to the theatre.
[00:19.39]I had a very good seat.
[00:22.07]The play was very interesting.
[00:25.10]I did not enjoy it.
[00:27.43]A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
[00:31.96]They were talking loudly.
[00:34.59]I got very angry.
[00:37.41]I could not hear the actors.
[00:40.64]I turned round.
[00:42.80]I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
